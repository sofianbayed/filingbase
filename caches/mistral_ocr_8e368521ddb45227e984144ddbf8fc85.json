We are excited about our business momentum, the availability of our automated driving stack, and our expansion to data centers and advanced robotics.\"\n\n## Fourth Quarter Results\n\n[tbl-0.html](tbl-0.html)\n\n## Fiscal 2025 Results\n\n[tbl-1.html](tbl-1.html)\n\n(1) Discussion regarding our use of Non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are included at the end of this news release in the sections labeled \"Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results.\"\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWith the enactment of recent U.S. tax legislation in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, we now expect our effective tax rate to generally remain in the 13% to 14% range and anticipate lower cash tax payments in future periods. However, this new tax legislation resulted in a non-cash $5.7 billion charge, or $5.29 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 to establish a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, as we now expect to be subject to the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax beginning in fiscal 2026. This charge was excluded from our Non-GAAP metrics but impacted our GAAP results.",

Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as “estimate,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek” and similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to: our dependence on a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium-tier handset devices; our customers vertically integrating; a significant portion of our business being concentrated in China, which is exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions; our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets; our strategic acquisitions, transactions and investments, and our ability to consummate strategic acquisitions; our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers; risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities; security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; the continued and future success of our licensing programs, which requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring; efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property, and other attacks on our licensing business model; potential changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise; adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on cellular and other communications technologies, including 5G, and our customers’ demand for our products based on these technologies; competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; failures in our products or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors; difficulties in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights; claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property; our use of open source software; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, declines in global, regional or local economic conditions, or our stock price and earnings volatility; geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises, and other factors outside of our control; our ability to comply with laws, regulations, policies and standards; our indebtedness; and potential tax liabilities.

      "markdown": "Qualcomm Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2025 Results\nPage 8 of 10\n\n# Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, \"Non-GAAP\" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein.\n\nWe use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We present Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations.\n\nNon-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items.\n\n- QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance.\n- Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies.\n- Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows:\n\n- Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information.\n\n- Acquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition.\n\n- We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense).\n\n- Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and through fiscal 2025 in which we were required to capitalize and amortize R&amp;D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we also excluded the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&amp;D expenditures. With the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), domestic R&amp;D expenditures may be deducted as incurred beginning in fiscal 2026. As a result, such favorable impact on our tax provision is not expected to continue in future periods.\n\n- Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect to use a fixed estimated Non-GAAP tax rate to determine our Non-GAAP provision for income taxes. We will determine our Non-GAAP tax rate annually based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast (computed inclusive of both current and deferred income taxes), adjusted to account for items excluded from our Non-GAAP earnings before taxes as well as certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded. We will periodically re-evaluate the appropriateness of our Non-GAAP tax rate and may adjust for significant changes, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, our corporate structure or tax laws. Prior periods have not been updated for this change as the effect would not be material.",
